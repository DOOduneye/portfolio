Based out of <span className="underline">Boston MA</span>, I am a second year Computer Science student at <span className="text-[#4ECDC4]">_Northeastern University_</span>,
as well as a Full Stack Software Developer.

I have strong passions about building technology that can solve meaningful problems, and I am always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow.
My main project currently is <span className="text-[#4ECDC4]">_Jurni_</span>, a mental health platorm that suppports patients through journaling. When I'm not coding, I'm probably in the gym, I love to powerliftâ€”I compete and aim to go to nationals in April of 2023.

I also love to travel and watch films. I'm a huge fan of <span className="text-[#4ECDC4]">_Nope_</span> currently and I'm
looking forward to seeing what else <span className="text-[#4ECDC4]">_Jordan Peele_</span> has in store for us.

I am currently looking for Spring 2023 / Summer 2023 internship, so if you are interested in working with me,
please reach <a href="mailto:oduneye.d@northeastern.edu" className="text-[#4ECDC4]">out</a>!
