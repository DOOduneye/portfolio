### Software Stack 

- [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) - For server-side rendering and dynamic routing, and for the build process. It was the best choice for this project because it is a React framework that is optimized for performance. 
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - For the front-end, pure JS was definitely an option, but React is a great framework for building UIs and when I knew there were going to be a lot of components, it was the best choice.
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - For styling, I chose Sass because it is a CSS preprocessor that makes it easier to write CSS. It also has a lot of features that make it easier to write CSS, such as variables, mixins, and nesting, much I didn't use because of the tool below but gave me the option to use them if I wanted to.
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styling, I chose TailwindCSS because it is a utility-first CSS framework that makes it easy to write CSS. It has a lot of prebuilt classes that make it easy to style components. It also has a lot of features that make it easy to write CSS, and customizing it is easy.
- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) - For icons, best library for icons.
- [Frame Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) - A great library for animation.
- [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) - For writing blog posts, MDX is a great library that allows you to write JSX in Markdown. In combination with NextJS, it makes it very easy to dynamically generate these posts.
