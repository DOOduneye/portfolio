Based out of [Boston MA](https://www.boston.gov/), I am a Computer Science student at [Northeastern University](https://www.northeastern.edu/). I am not only honing my skills in computer science but also expanding my knowledge as a Full Stack Software and Machine Learning Engineer. With a strong passion for building technology that can solve meaningful problems, I am always seeking new opportunities to learn and grow.

I am currently working at [Genentech](https://www.gene.com/) as an NLP Data Analyst Intern improving data processing systems.

When I am not coding, I can often be found in the gym, as I am an avid [Powerlifter](https://www.openpowerlifting.org/u/davidoduneye). I compete regularly and have set my sights on completeing a couple meets in the next few months. In addition to my love for technology and fitness, I also enjoy photography, traveling, and watching films. Currently, I am a huge fan of the film [Spiderman Across the Spiderverse](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9362722/) and a large fan of [Jordan Peele](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1443502/). 

I am currently seeking a Spring 2024 / Spring 2024 internship, I welcome any opportunity to work with others in the industry. If you are interested in working with me, please do not hesitate to reach out [here](davidoduneye1@gmail.com).
