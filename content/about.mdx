Based out of [Boston MA](https://www.boston.gov/), I am a second year Computer Science student at [Northeastern University](https://www.northeastern.edu/),
as well as a Full Stack Software Developer.

I have strong passions about building technology that can solve meaningful problems, and I am always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow.
My main project currently is [Jurni](https://davidoduney.com/projects) a mental health platorm that suppports patients through journaling. When I'm not coding, I'm probably in the gym, I love to [Powerlift](https://www.openpowerlifting.org/u/davidoduneye)â€”I compete and aim to go to nationals in April of 2023.

I also love to travel and watch films. I'm a huge fan of [Nope](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10954984/) currently and I'm looking forward to seeing what else [Jordan Peele](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1443502/) has in store for us. I am currently looking for Summer 2023 internship, so if you are interested in working with me, please reach [out](https://davidoduneye.com/contact)!
