The biggest and most consistently important moment in my life was when I began to write.
It was fueled by my loneliness and desire to be accepted by whatever community wanted me.
I didn't write this to get pity, this is just the best medium for me to express myself.

It began in elementary school through an activity offered by my teacher.
She would require us to write in a notebook for 15-20 minutes at the beginning of class.
To write about whatever came to our mind and either build upon it each day or create something new.
This was perfect for my ADHD ridden mind.
Writing about anything I wanted lead me to write about space aliens, and island trapped survivors, a man on a quest for a sword, and more, but somehow conceptualized into one long-running story.
My toes were hypothetically wetted and they didn't really get much more so until middle school where I started reading.

I think every kid has one book series they followed harshly&mdash;into their adulthood.
Mine was Harry Potter.
I read plenty other fantasy and science fiction books but nothing but the Harry Potter series seeped into my mentality.
I read and finished all the book in 3-4 months and then moved on onto the films.
It attracted me so much to the world of fiction that I wanted to create my own.

I did just that, wrote a couple short things in a journal during class when I had free time, then during class when I didnâ€™t have free time.
It was flourishing to do something that made me happy that I ignored every other important task.
These almost meaningless beginning manuscripts lead me formulating and creating&mdash;at the time amazing work.

The truly first, and most important work was '_The Cove_'.
Tells the story of a billionaire who is insane enough to predict the end of times and prepares for it.
I spent over 3 years on it and it at the time was beautiful to me.
Though **warning**, grammar, punctuation, fluency of words and phrases, and general story telling techniques are missing.
It is also 56 pages long, with a very rushed ending.
It was the best of what I could do, with my time, and my ability to fixate.
I was 13 when I finished it and I was proud of it.
