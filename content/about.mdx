Based out of <u>Boston MA</u>, I am a second year Computer Science student at <a href='https://www.northeastern.edu/' target='_blank'>_Northeastern University_</a>,
as well as a Full Stack Software Developer.

I have strong passions about building technology that can solve meaningful problems, and I am always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow.
My main project currently is <a href="https://davidoduneye.com/projects">_Jurni_</a>, a mental health platorm that suppports patients through journaling. When I'm not coding, I'm probably in the gym, I love to <a href='https://www.openpowerlifting.org/u/davidoduneye' target='_blank'>_Powerlift_</a>â€”I compete and aim to go to nationals in April of 2023.

I also love to travel and watch films. I'm a huge fan of <a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10954984/' target='_blank'>_Nope_</a> currently and I'm
looking forward to seeing what else <a href='https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1443502/' target='_blank'>_Jordan Peele_</a> has in store for us.

I am currently looking for Spring 2023 / Summer 2023 internship, so if you are interested in working with me,
please reach <a href="mailto:oduneye.d@northeastern.edu">out</a>!
