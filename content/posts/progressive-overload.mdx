TL;DR - a way to increase strength through increasing intensity

Strength training is a type of physical exercise that is designed to improve muscle endurance, size, and strength. It is a vital component of any well-rounded fitness routine, as it can help to improve physical performance, reduce the risk of injury, and increase bone density.

One of the key principles of strength training is the concept of overloading. In order to continue making progress and adapting to the demands of strength training, it is necessary to gradually increase the workload placed on the muscles. This process is known as progressive overloading.

Progressive overloading involves gradually increasing the intensity of your strength training workouts over time. This can be achieved by increasing the weight lifted, the number of repetitions performed, or the number of sets completed. By consistently challenging your muscles with a greater workload, you can stimulate muscle growth and strength adaptations.

It is important to note that progressive overloading should be implemented gradually and carefully. It is essential to listen to your body and not try to increase the intensity of your workouts too quickly. Sudden increases in workload can lead to injury or burnout.

There are several ways to implement progressive overloading in your strength training routine. One common method is to increase the weight lifted by a small amount each week. For example, if you are currently able to complete 3 sets of 8 reps of a particular exercise with 50 pounds, you could aim to increase the weight to 52.5 pounds the following week.

Another way to implement progressive overloading is to increase the number of reps or sets performed. For example, you might start by completing 3 sets of 8 reps of an exercise and aim to increase to 3 sets of 10 reps the following week.

It is important to track your progress and make sure that you are consistently challenging yourself in your strength training workouts. This will help to ensure that you are making progress and not plateauing.
