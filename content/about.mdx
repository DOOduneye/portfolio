I'm a second year Computer Science student at <span className="text-[#4ECDC4]">_Northeastern University_</span>,
as well as a Full Stack Software Developer.

I am passionate about building software that is both beautiful and functional.
I am currently working on a few projects, which you can see on my github!
I also love to write about my experiences and learnings not only in software development,
but also in life. You can find my blog posts on my website.
When I am not coding,
I love to powerliftâ€”I compete and aim to go to nationals in April of 2023.
I also love to travel and watch films. I am currently based in Boston, MA.

I am looking for a Spring 2023 internship,
so if you are interested in working with me,
please reach <a href="mailto:oduneye.d@northeastern.edu" className="text-[#4ECDC4]">out</a>!
