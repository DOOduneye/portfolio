When it comes to Computer Science, the best thing about it, and why I recommend it to everyone to try out is that it's so easy to get started.

You can start programming and make almost anything in no time at all. There are tons of videos on youtube and websites that support you throughout those moments. The one I recommend the most often is [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) as the name says, its free tutorials on everything you could think of. Every language, every project style, even tutorials on the math and concepts you'll need on the job and for a coding interview. Which is immensely useful if thats how you learn. 

Realistically most people don't learn that way, especially beginners. They learn by _doing_, and that's what I'm going to talk about today.

### <span className="underline underline-offset-8">The Mystery of Computer Science</span>

Computer Science has an essence of mystery to it, a majority of the world is tech illiterate, and the part of the population who believes they are tech literate, are speaking about their ability to reset the wifi. So to the general populus programming is seen as an incredibly hard and unknown skill, which it definitely can be, but most of the time, not so much. This mentality though creates a bit of cloudiness in what programming really is and now learning the subject is seen as a daunting task.

I remember when I took my first programming course in High School, we learned about programming Ti-84 calculators and very simple HTML and CSS websites. In this I loved the ability to have the ability to produce absolutely anything I wanted. Gave me serious control as if I was back in my era of writing. 

Took that little spark and wanted to learn so much more about it, and how to _really_ program as I was told that HTML and CSS weren't programming languages.


### <span className="underline underline-offset-8">A "Beginner's" Journey </span>

The first thing beginners get stuck at is which programming language is best to learn. Simply I say Python as it's the most versatile language you can learn without overcomplicating yourself with a lot of things you don't need to know yet, but this question is more than that. 

This question shows how misplaced beginners goals are. It's a direct correlation of knowing a programming language to knowing how to program and create things. Which is unfortunately not how it works, but you feel very accomplished following the 8 hour video and taking slight notes on concepts such as variables and loops. Though you won't really have a meaningful understanding of what they are, and how to take advantage of these concepts in the best way. 

These tutorials give you a bare minimum of the knowledge you need, which for somoene who already understands these concepts in other languages will be enough but not sufficient for someone who doesn't. They hand hold you through the entire experience and give you false hope in when they let you go. After the video, if you get through it all, you'll be unable to do anything without going back and reffering to the video multiple times and giving up when you don't understand something.

So how do we overcome this tutorial hell and actually learn how to program?

One way is to focus on projects. Instead of just learning the syntax and basic concepts of a programming language, try to build something with what you've learned. This could be as simple as a to-do list app or a basic calculator. By working on projects, you'll be forced to apply what you've learned and also discover new concepts that you may not have learned in a tutorial.

Another way is to seek out additional resources. Don't just rely on a single tutorial or course. Look for different explanations and perspectives on the same concept. This will help you get a deeper understanding and also ensure that you're not just memorizing syntax without truly understanding the underlying concepts.

It's also important to not get discouraged and to keep pushing through. Learning how to program can be challenging at times, but it's also incredibly rewarding. So don't give up and keep trying new things. With time and practice, you'll be able to overcome tutorial hell and become a proficient programmer.
