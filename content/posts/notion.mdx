If you've never heard, Notion is a tool for organizing your work and for me my entire life. You can create notes, docs, and to-do lists with Notion and then organize them into workflows. Notion is simple and easy to get started with, but it's also powerful enough to help you with your most complex projects.

Notion has had tried and true reliability and has quickly become my go-to tool for maintaining a schedule and staying organized. I've tried a lot of different productivity tools and systems over the years, but none of them have been as versatile and meaningfully functional as Notion has.

## **THE GIST**

Here's how Notion has helped me stay on top of my schedule and stay organized and how it can help you as well:

# **1.** The calendar feature is fantastic. I've always struggled to keep track of my schedule and ensure I don't miss any critical deadlines. The calendar feature in Notion has been a lifesaver. I can easily see what's coming up and make sure I'm prepared for it.
   
# **2**. The to-do list feature is also great. I tend to forget about things I need to do unless I write them down. The to-do list feature in Notion helps me keep track of everything I need to do in one place. I can even set reminders for myself, so I don't forget anything.
   
# **3**. I can easily keep track of projects with Notion. I'm working on a lot of different projects at any given time. Notion helps me keep track of each project and all of its tasks. I can even share projects with other people and collaborate with them easily.
   
# **4**. In comparison to other productivity tools, Notion upholds itself on being usable on all levels. Beginners can get a Notion page up and running in minutes, while more advanced or *power* users can create complex workflows and databases that are tailored to their needs.
   
5. The large user page and community is a great resource for learning how to use Notion. There are a lot of people who use Notion and they're always willing to help out. As with that, it means you never have to start at 0. If you want to set up a page for your own use, you can find a template that's already been created and use that as a starting point.

####  I use Notion in College**

As you can tell, I am able to keep track of my classes, projects, spending habits, and more all in one place. I can easily see what I need to do and when I need to do it. I can also easily see what I've done and what I still need to do. Through this I am able to stay on top of my schedule and stay focused. I can also easily share my page with others and collaborate with them.

This is most explicit in my semester pages.

This first part gives me useful information that I take in; most of the stuff here is information I know with certainty but always enjoy having to combat moments of confusion. It's also connected to a larger framework. The courses tab takes in data from several databases that hold my course path through my years at Northeastern and the courses for this specific semester.

With it, comes lectures and lecture notes that I can access, review and take advantage of (yes, I take notes on my math courses usually). LaTeX is a potent tool that is integrated into Notion.

This next part is my main schedule of coursework. As most college courses reveal the work expected for the semester during syllabus week, I take advantage of that and pour all the due dates onto this page which allows me to continuously track what work I need to get done and how much time I have left.

I will not deny that using Notion as I do is time-consuming, but it's only for a sector of time. Then it becomes automatic and highly beneficial to a consistent organizational experience.
